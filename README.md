## Public Mapper Definition

Public mapper definitions are standard peer-reviewed repository for community sharing and usage to help keep definitions up-to-date. Intended to be used and maintained by community.

Contributions are welcome! See the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md).

## Private Mapper Definition

If your enterprise has a specific object model that will be used in integrations and you would like to keep those definitions private then you can point to a JSON file hosted on your own web servers.
