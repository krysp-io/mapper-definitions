Shared Field Mapper Definitions
Public field definitions that are peer-reviewed and merged into this repository for community sharing and usage to help keep definitions up-to-date.
Intended to be used and maintained by community.


Private Field Mapper Definitions
If your enterprise has a specific object model that will be used in integrations and you would like to keep those definitions private then you can point to a JSON file hosted on your own web servers.
